GENKI-4K: Images of 4000 faces with expression and head orientation labels 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the GENKI-4K dataset, collected by the Machine Perception Laboratory,
University of California, San Diego. This dataset contains 4000 images along 
with expression (smile=1, non-smile=0) labels and pose labels (yaw, pitch, and roll, in radians). The file "GENKI-4K_Images.txt" contains the ordered names 
of the 4000 image files (one per line). The file "GENKI-4K_Labels.txt" contains 
the labels, where the Nth line of the file corresponds to the image specified in
the Nth line in the "Images" file.

The "files" directory contains 4000 symbolic links, where file0001.jpg links
to the file named by the first line of GENKI-4K_Images.txt, and so on. I.e.
reading in the aliases gives the same images in the same order as that 
specified in GENKI-4K_Images.txt.
